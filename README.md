# stainlib
Python 3 library for the augmentation &amp; normalisation of H&amp;E images
![Currently implemented methods in stainlib](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1By4Nw3X0sgwxamF0qN3TqiL-B1q2qZqQ)
Our objective with this repository is to provide an easy to use python 3 library that includes 
the most commonly used methods for color augmentation and normalisation of histopathology images, having as input local image regions.

## Pre-requisites
The library was developed and tested in a python 3.8 conda environment.  The following packages are required:
- scikit-image
- scipy
- pillow
- opencv-python
- spams
You can find the complete list of packages installed when developed the library under utils/enviroment.yml
 
## Examples
You can find examples for using stainlib in the jupyter notebooks stainlib_augmentation.ipynb and stainlib_normalization.ipynb
